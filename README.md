# Bank-Transaction-Database
The purpose of this program is to serve as a command-line utility database of bank accounts. It is meant to run from a Unix or Linux terminal by typing "python accounts.py -[argument]". See the list at the bottom of the README file for the argument options. The user has the ability to display information, view the history of transactions, or enter a a transaction for a specified account (chosen using the integer next to the name on the account). Account data is stored in a colon-delimited text file that serves as the accounting database. The current text file in the repository holds example transactional data so the user can learn how the program works and how the data is stored, in addition to how the user interface works from the command line. 

Note: Delete the entries from the text file for a fresh start. 

Options for Argument 1:
     
     -i : Displays account information
     
     -h : Displays account history
     
     -t : Allows the user to enter a transaction
     
     -? : Get information on how to use the program
